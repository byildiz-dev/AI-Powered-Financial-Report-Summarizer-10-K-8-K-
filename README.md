## Notes on System Performance

This application is designed **for educational purposes** and provides general sentiment analysis of financial reports. While it can identify positive, neutral, or negative tones in a document, it **is not trained to predict exact market reactions or investor behavior**. Users should be aware that real-world financial events may produce outcomes that differ from the sentiment identified by the system.  

The system’s results should therefore be interpreted as **informative insights** rather than actionable investment guidance. It is intended to help users understand report content, practice financial analysis, and explore natural language processing techniques in finance.
